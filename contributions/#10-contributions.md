It's #hacktoberfest and you can contribute by simply adding aerospace-related crates to the new [aerorust.org](https://aerorust.org) website.

[CRATE by AeroRust] [NMEA 0183 - Supporting additional sentences](https://github.com/AeroRust/nmea/issues/54)
Another #hacktoberfest issue for adding parsing of new sentences currently not available in the NMEA 0183 crate. Check out the issue and start by writing a single parser with the provided resources.

[CRATE by AeroRust] [Call for content](https://github.com/AeroRust/AeroRust.github.io/issues/3) for the new AeroRust website.
We want to fill in the website with additional information about the community, how people can join, contribute, etc. We even have a blog that needs articles related to the aerospace industry and Rust, so if you have ideas, share them in the issue.
